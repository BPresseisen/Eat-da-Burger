# Eat-da-Burger
  
This is an app in node express-handlebars to log different burgers for tracking of which ones have been eaten (devoured). In a person's quest for a completionist's record of potential and consumed burger journeys and delights, this app is a must-have.
  
It was important to build, test, and deploy a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and that is what is released in this first version.

After a new user enters their responses in the survey, the data file, findYour1.js is evaluated to determine the perfect match from among the existing users in the application.
  
  
## Deployment

Git clone the files to a local directory of your choice. Make sure to run the npm installations!
  
Find Your 1 is also deployed in Heroku and can be reached via this link:
