# Eat-da-Burger
  
This is an app in node express-handlebars to log different burgers for the purpse of tracking which ones have been eaten (devoured) by the user. In a person's quest for a record of potential and consumed burger journeys, this app is a must-have.
  
It was important to build, test, and deploy a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and that is what is released in this first version.

The app is fairly straight-forward and it is evident from the main page what the user can do:
